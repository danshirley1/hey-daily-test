# HeyDaily Take-Home test

Hello! And welcome to the HeyDaily take-home coding test.

The goal of this challenge is to assess your full-stack engineering capabilities and overall feel for product design.

## The Brief
This repo provides a partially complete skeleton for a post view. Your task is to complete the post view to the best of
your abilities within a ~3 hour time window. You may choose to focus on one or more of the following parts:
- Making the post view look beautiful
- Implementing a datastore and APIs to save and load posts
- Implementing the display of comments and/or reactions in the UI
- Implementing the backend logic and datastore for comments and/or reactions
- Anything else you think would make the post viewing experience delightful and engaging for our subscribers

Once complete please:
- Send your results to [robert@heydaily.co](mailto:robert@heydaily.co). Include:
  - a summary of the changes you made
  - a description of any further changes you'd like to make if you had time
  - and of course access to the code!
- Book a call to present your solution using [this link](https://calendly.com/robert-hd/30min)

Do reach out asap if you're having any issues getting the project to run or understanding the task!

## Getting Started
First, install the packages:
```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```


Next, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the homepage and
[http://localhost:3000/postId](http://localhost:3000/postId) to view with the post with id `postId`.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on
[http://localhost:3000/api/](http://localhost:3000/api/). These endpoints can be edited in `pages/api/`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as
[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
